# A React Toggle Quiz Component by Aoife McLoughlin
A reusable question/answer toggle component made using TypeScript, React and Tailwind css.

## Getting started
To begin please run:
```npm install ```

## Limitations

No ability to navigate between different quizzes. Only the predefined and limited data for a singular quiz can be used at the moment. Future versions could see a range of different quiz data structures by using a createContext hook and managing global state related to a quiz.


## Assumptions

Only one question shown on the page at a time.

All questions are plain strings.

All toggle answer options are strings.

No navigation beyond the question and answer component required.
